## A mysterious castle that was suddenly built

Tate Castle was suddenly built 150 years ago. Just before Japan was reborn as a modern nation, the Matsumae Clan, which ruled Hokkaido, moved their castle from Matsumae by the sea to Atsusawabe inland. However, the castle was attacked by the forces of the former Shogunate led by Takeyoshi Enomoto and Tate Castle fell, and now only the moat, earthen mounds, and foundation stones of the buildings remain.
